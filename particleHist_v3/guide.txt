you can choose if take fie from input or make a simultaion
./execName input fileName
or 
./execName sim numberOfEvents [seedNumber]
 and next to that you can choose what "analyzator" use (ParticleMass or Dump)

AnalysisInfo object that have and works on input words given by terminal.

AnalysisSteering manage the analysis: Dump Events (EventDump), manage the MassMean object that find the mean im and its std and put them in a histogram for a type of particle (particleMass) 

SourceFactory is a Factory of eventSource .Taking an analysisInfo object it creates the right EventSource derivated (EventSim or Eventreadfromfile) 

AnalysisFactory is a Factory of AnalysisSteering. 
There is an AbstractFactory of the AnlalysisSteering which make possibile create runtime AnalysisSteering object dependig on the command line.


EventSource: specialize himself in EventReadFromFile(take the events from a file) and EventSim (silmulate the events)

mass.cc compute invariant mass of an event

MassMean makes the statistic analysis 

Costants contains useful costants

utilities contains useful function to compute energy, inv mass...
