you can choose if take fie from input or make a simultaion
./execName input fileName
or 
./execName sim numberOfEvents [seedNumber]
 and next to that you can choose what "analyzator" use (particlemass dump or particlelifetime)
to get ranges: 
for ParticleMass : ParticleMassRanges fileName.
for ParticleLifetime : ParticleLifetimeRanges fileName.
otherwise is gonna take classic K0 and Lambda0

for Example: ./main input particle_events.txt particlemass ParticleMassRanges massRanges particlelifetime ParticleLifetimeRanges particleFitters


AnalysisInfo object that have and works on input words given by terminal.

AnalysisSteering manage the analysis: Dump Events (EventDump), manage the MassMean object that find the mean im and its std and put them in a histogram for a type of particle (particleMass). ParticleMass e EventDump inherit from ActiveObserver<Event>.
ParticleLifeTime is very similiar to ParticleMass but for the times.

SourceFactory is a Factory of eventSource .Taking an analysisInfo object it creates the right EventSource derivated (EventSim or Eventreadfromfile) 

AnalysisFactory is a Factory of AnalysisSteering. 
There is an AbstractFactory of the AnlalysisSteering which make possibile create runtime AnalysisSteering object dependig on the command line.


EventSource: specialize himself in EventReadFromFile(take the events from a file) and EventSim (silmulate the events)

TFileProxy is a Proxy o TFile used to save the mass and the decay time histograms on the same ROOT file.(TFILE MODE is now on create: can't reopen a file... you can put UPDATE)

ParticleReco compute total energy and invariant mass and it inherit form the template "Singleton" and from "LazyObservers" (energy and im are comuted in the update() function).

ProperTime compute the decayTime and it inherit from the template "Singleton" and from "LazyObserver".

MassMean makes the statistic analysis for the masses, LifeTimeFit is its corrispettive for the lifetime.


Costants contains useful costants

utilities contains useful function to compute energy, inv mass...
